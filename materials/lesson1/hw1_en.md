# Lesson 1
## Homework
1. You need to implement the API described in the OpenAPI specification in the course repository - https://github.com/hexzedels/big-golang-2nd
2. For now, it's acceptable not to implement the core scheduling logic and instead add a TODO placeholder
3. For now, it's acceptable not to run your service in Docker
4. For now, it's acceptable not to connect a real database using Docker Compose or standalone (but it's better if you do)
5. Add me (https://github.com/hexzedels) as a collaborator to your project and submit a PR for review, targeting the main branch (not just your repository, but specifically a PR within it).

## Materials
1. Codegeneration from OpenAPI specification - https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/
2. Database migration tool - https://github.com/pressly/goose
